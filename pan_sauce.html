            <p>A seared piece of meat might sound boring. But when its drizzled with a silky reduction? Always exciting.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (preferrably pan drippings)</li>
                    <li>1 whole shallot, halved or minced (optional)</li>
                    <li>1 whole garlic clove, halved or minced (optional)</li>
                    <li>1/4 of flavourful alcohol</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup vegetable, beef or chicken stock</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons butter (a splash of cream works wonders here)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch (optionally adds a nice thickness to the sauce)</li>
                    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once youve cleared the pan, add tablespoon of oil and saute the shallots and garlic on medium high heat until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Pour in wine or other alcohol and as it simmers, scrape up any and all fond from the bottom of the pan with a spatula.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the alcohol reduce by about half, roughly three minutes, then pour in the stock and stir into the reduction. Allow the pan to come to a rapid simmer.</li>
                    <li>Simmer for 3-5 minutes or until reduced by about half or to desired consistency. Pick up and move the pan to gauge how much the sauce is reducing.</li>
                    <li>Turn the heat down and begin to stir in the butter or cream and continue to stir until completely melted or incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy! Pan sauces are at their very best used right away. Drizzle it over your meal or let guests spoon some for themselves.</li>
                </ol>

                If your pan sauce reduces too much or it becomes too thick, whisk in a little extra stock to reach a thinner, more pourable consistency.
